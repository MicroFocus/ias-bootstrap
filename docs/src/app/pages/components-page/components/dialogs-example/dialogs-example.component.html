<h2>Dialogs</h2>
<p class="ias-page-instructions">
    Dialogs allow for a system to overtly call the attention of the user away from the page to its content. A dialog's
    content is always something a developer would like the user to do or know. Dialogs are tied to the current page to
    keep information available to users as they interact with the component. Some usage examples could be a warning
    message, instructions, or input fields necessary for progression.
